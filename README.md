# What is this repository about?
Gesture Launcher is an app launcher (the thing that manages the home screen, listing apps and starting them etc.) that is based purely on touch gestures.

# What is considered a gesture?
These touch gestures can be drawn with multiple fingers and you can also lift fingers from the screen and place them somewhere else, thus drawing multiple, separate lines and/or dots. If you do this fast enough, it will still be counted as one gesture.

# Why does this exist?
This project is a self-experiment. I wanted to know if launching apps using short drawings helps me using my phone in a more productive way. As a proof-of-concept, I consider it a full success. I am now using it in my everyday life to see if it makes sense to continue with the development. Because of this, the code is sometimes **very ugly**; as soon as I have the time, I will refactor it to also make the whole thing more stable.

# Do you need this?
Probably not. If you use Android and feel adventurous, please, go ahead. I would also be very interested in feedback! Feel free to open an issue or pull request to voice your opinion!
To use it, one pre-defined gesture is very useful: Double tap, then draw a straight vertical line upwards (starting from where you double tapped). This will lead you to an activity to manage your saved gestures.
